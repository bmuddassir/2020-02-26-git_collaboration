Git Collaboration Basics Training

- `clone`: "Downloading" a repository from cloud to our local computer
  - You only need to do this once just like the `init` command
- `branch <name>`: Create a branch called <name>
  - `checkout <name>` or `switch <name>`: To move `HEAD` (i.e. switch) to that branch
  - `push <branch>` `pull <branch>`: Need to be mindful of which branch we need to push/pull
